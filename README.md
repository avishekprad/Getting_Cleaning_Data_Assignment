2) Unzip the file and read all the files. Provide the column names while reading the files.
3) merge the files under training dataset with that of the test dataset
4) From the merged dataset, extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
5) merge the dataset with the activity dataset to provide decriptive activity names
